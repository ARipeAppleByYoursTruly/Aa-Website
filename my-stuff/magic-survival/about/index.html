                Magic Survival is a 2D action arcade game developed by LEME for Android devices, where you control a character with magical abilities to survive the endless horde of enemies for as long as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It incorporates the RNG nature of roguelike games through the magic select screen when leveling up, and randomly-placed chests that each contain a random artifact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the v0.82 update, the average play time of each run would be roughly around an hour, further varied by the player's game knowledge and skills. Every choice you make when leveling up feels like a life or death situation, which, in my opinion, feels pretty punishing like a soulslike game. Part of the reason could be the slow accumulation of mana needed to level up, and the inescapable damage fall-off when fusing 2 magic together.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the literally game-changing v0.82 update, 30 mins is the new average play time of a run. 1-hour runs are now pretty hard to achieve thanks to the accelerated enemy spawn rates. I have yet to survive past 33 mins, so I got a long way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal thoughts, this game works best at killing time when you're on a train or waiting for the food to arrive. While this does have a progression system, it doesn't demand your full commitment, so you're free to take some breaks to deal with the matter at hand and still be able to come back to this game.
